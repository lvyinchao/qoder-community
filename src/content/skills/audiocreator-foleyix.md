## Use Cases

- Write, optimize, or repair prompts for background music, vocal songs, podcasts, ambience, effects, narration, dialogue, and sound scenes.
- Preserve exact lyrics or spoken words while clarifying delivery, timing, textures, and exclusions.
- Generate audio through an authorized Foleyix account, inspect existing tasks, and download private WAV results.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add lvyinchao/foleyix-skill --skill audiocreator-foleyix -a qoder
```

Install the complete skill directory, including its references and script. Version 1.4.1 is available from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/lvyinchao/foleyix-skill/releases/tag/v1.4.1).

## Examples

```text
Use audiocreator-foleyix to write a prompt for gentle instrumental background music for a travel video. Include acoustic guitar and soft piano; no vocals or lyrics. Return the prompt only.
```

```text
Use audiocreator-foleyix to generate a calm forest ambience with distant birds and light wind. No speech or music. Save the WAV and report the result's actual duration.
```

Prompt-only requests require no login, local runtime, or generation quota. When account operations or generation are requested, the bundled CLI requires Node.js 22.20+ and network access. The user completes device authorization on Foleyix; the agent must not read passwords or approve on the user's behalf.

## Notes

- The skill and CLI are free MIT-0 software; actual generation uses the user's Foleyix trial or subscription quota.
- Audio types and limits share a capability catalog with the website. Background music and vocal songs use different prompt guidance.
- The CLI lists the connected account's saved voices with `node scripts/foleyix.mjs voices --json`. Repeated `--voice-id ID` flags bind up to three distinct, completed, retained voice references in `@voice1`, `@voice2`, `@voice3` order. Each reference is limited to 30 seconds and 10 MB; the compiled prompt, including reference descriptions, must fit 3,000 characters.
- Creating, importing or uploading saved voices, batch game effects and programme exports use website workflows. The CLI does not provide voice upload or creation.
- Requested duration is guidance. Report completion only after the existing task and its delivered file have been checked; downloading an existing result does not consume new generation quota.
